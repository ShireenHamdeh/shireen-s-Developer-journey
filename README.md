# Shireen Hamdeh - Developer Portfolio

Welcome to my personal developer portfolio! This project was built using only HTML and CSS to showcase my background, skills, education, and career aspirations.

## üí° About

I'm Shireen Hamdeh, a Computer Engineer from Ramallah, Palestine. I built this portfolio as part of my application to a training program that will help me gain experience in frontend development and move closer to my goal of becoming a Full Stack Developer.

This site is entirely handcrafted without the use of external libraries or frameworks, as required by the program instructions.
